    <h1>Polar Bears are the Best!</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">

        <p>Polar bears are Earth's best animals because they have some pretty awesome features. First, they have huge paws that make navigation on the ice easier. Also, they have cool white fur that acts as camouflage.</p>

        <p>Polar bears also have huge claws. Interestingly, polar bears are considered marine mammals, just like whales, seals, and dolphins.</p>

        <p>One of the cutest things about these big, dangerous bears is that they will touch noses to check in about food. See below!</p>
